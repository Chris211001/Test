{"type":"success","message":"At the beginning of a game, the chessboard is set up with a white square in the bottom right corner. For those who know English, this sentence is easy to remember: White on Right.

The pieces are then placed on both sides in a symmetrical fashion. The second row is entirely occupied by pawns. In the corners, you'll find the rooks, and right next to them, the knights. Next in line are the bishops, and in the middle, the royal couple stands. The queen always goes on a square of her color (White Queen on a white square, Black Queen on a black square), and the king goes on the last remaining square.

Each of the six chess pieces moves differently. Except for the knight, which can jump over other pieces, pieces cannot move through or onto a square already occupied by another of their own pieces. However, they can move onto squares occupied by an opponent's piece, capturing it, and forcing it to leave the board. Typically, one moves their own pieces to squares from which they can either attack the opponent's pieces, protect their own pieces, or control other important squares on the board.

The goal of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king. This occurs when the king is in check and cannot escape from the threat. If a king cannot evade a check, the game ends. Traditionally, the king is not captured or removed from the board but the game is simply concluded.
